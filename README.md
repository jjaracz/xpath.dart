XPath 2.0 Implementation in Dart

Target Spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xpath20-20101214/

Why XPath 2.0? In XPath 2.0 result sets are sequences of other sequences, elements or atomic values. This coupled with XML type awareness and extended functions makes XPath 2.0 a potentially uber powerful approach to working with XML.

This project supercedes the GWT project xpath4js (http://code.google.com/p/xpath4js).
