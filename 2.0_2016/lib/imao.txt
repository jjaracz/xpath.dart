LIKE about dart

structure
optional type annotation
economical syntax
string interpolation
factory contructors and use of new keyword (although no way to signal that the result object is a singleton)
map and list empty init shortcut "{} or []"
json map initialisation
style guide
member constructors
futures (most intuitive method of async operation i've come across so far)
no need for char type to work with string elements

ISSUES

lack of enum (looking fwd to it)
construction of super class vars a little awkward
using string.concat instead of +=
issues inheriting from List<T>
uppercase String type (no lower case alias) - would save a lot of shift keystrokes
member constructors - would like to use MyClass.default(){ ... }
newList = [0].addAll([1,2,3]);  works but.... result = [my1stElement()].addAll(result); does not
